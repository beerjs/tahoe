BeerJS Tahoe
============

BeerJS Tahoe is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and learn collectively about JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.

Topics so far have been around JavaScript, but in reality the scope is pretty open. We start the metup by just hanging out and chatting then we will get into presentations. Anyone can present for any amount of time.


Want to hang out?
-----------------

We aim to meet on the 4th **THURSDAY** of each month but mileage may vary depending on the organizer's travel plans, whether Mercury is in retrograde, or if there's been amazing winter snowstorms. Meeting location varies, but tends to be at one of a few awesome local establishments in town (I'm looking at you Sidellis, the Hangar, SLBC, and the Coachman Hotel).

And what is BeerJS without a beer sponsor? Wait, what's that? We don't have one?! Oh no... If you want to sponsor this meetup please email Rob (link below) to get things squared away.

Don't forget to star BeerJS Tahoe too!


Want to share something?
-----------------------

You can show something you built, talk about something you would like to build, challenge "best" practices, or change the world; your call. Also feel free to come with problems and questions about your code, my code, or whatever (it's your life, do you want!).

But really, we're always looking for speakers, and truly believe everyone has something interesting to contribute. Don't be shy.

The Community
-------------

Community is the reason why we do what we do.  We highly value growing together and here are some places where you can do just that.  We can share relevant and cool content, questions, and start discussions... you get the idea.
